# California Housing

## My hello world Data Science project


Inpired by Aurelien "Hands-on machine learning" chapter 2 book, here is another model for the California Housing Prices dataset, using the Scikit-Learn framework in the intire process.
It's a mere exercise, where I perform EDA, clean and preprocess the dataset; then I'm going to train, evaluate, fine-tune and deploy a machine learning model for predict house prices.
